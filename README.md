  -Explored covert bias in LLMs using ChatGPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5, and Llama 3.2 as case studies
  
  -Investigated covert bias in these models by analyzing numerical values assigned to speaker characteristics (Intelligence, kindness, sophistication, aggression, emotional,      laziness, factual) through direct and indirect comparison of AAVE and SAE prompts
  
  -Conducted counterfactual fine-tuning on Llama 3.2 to evaluate the persistence of biases in fine-tuned language model. 
# Fine-Tuning Multimodal Foundation Models for Dementia Diagnosis
[Fine-Tuning Multimodal Foundation Models for Dementia Diagnosis.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18235249/Fine-Tuning.Multimodal.Foundation.Models.for.Dementia.Diagnosis.pdf)

  -Evaluated foundation models for dementia classification, focusing on performance and resource efficiency compared to specialized models.
  
  -Fine-tuned the LLaVA model with MRI data and benchmarked its performance against the baseline model - EfficientNet 
  
  -Determined the minimum training data required for the LLaVA model to achieve results comparable to the full dataset and baseline model.
  
  -Validated model robustness and generalizability using unseen datasets (ADNI) and cross-evaluations between OASIS and ADNI datasets.

  # Exploration of LAyer-SElective Rank reduction
  
  -Analyzed LASER’s impact across transformer layers to identify optimal noise-reduction points for specific tasks.
  
  -Compared lower vs. higher-order SVD components using TF-IDF and named recognition to assess semantic coherence and prediction specificity.
  
  -Explored heuristics like nuclear norm and effective rank to identify optimal LASER layer and developed a shared subspace rank metric for         reliable layer selection.
